    <p>Hi! I am Shae Muller. I am <em>almost</em> 21 years old (my birthday is March 27th, 1997).
      I am an undergraduate student at the <strong>Universty of Delware</strong> majoring in MIS
      (Managment Infromation Systems) with a concentration in Marketing and a minor in International Business Studies.
    <br /><br />If you would like to learn more about my professional background please use this link:

    <h2>Background </h2>
    I would like to give you more personal background about myself rather than professional background.
    Anyone can view my professional credintials on LinkedIn and Handshake, however my personal background is not as
    easily accessable.<br /> I was born in Cocoa, Florida and I lived there for the first 4 years of my life.
    My family and I moved to southern New Jersey after I turned 4. I have lived in South Jersey for the majority of my
    life.  
    I have a wide variety of interests ranging from information systems to animals. When instructed to create
    a web page for my MISY330 (<em>a Web Application Development course</em>), it took me very little time to come
    to the conclusion that I would like to do a web page about my dog Francy. </p>
