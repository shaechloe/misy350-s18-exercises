    <h2>Life As Francy The Dog</h2>

    <p>This <strong>Francy Carmen Muller</strong>. She is <strong>10</strong> years old and was born on December 5th, 2007. She is a mixed breed but likes to be considered a <em>designer dog</em>. She is a mix between a papilion and a poodle, which is called
      a <strong>Papipoo</strong>. You can read more about her breed later on in the
      <a href="#breed">Breed Information</a> section of this page.
      <br />
      <br /> Francy was raised by my (Shae's) mother, Angela. However, she now resides with my father in Shamong, New Jersey. In Shamong, Francy and my father take daily walks around the block. She use to be not very good on the leash and obeying rules
      when she was Puppy. My dad has really worked with her and trained her and she is much better now. She obeys him for the most part and even can walk leash-less around the block with him. Sometimes, she will still run a little too far ahead on her
      walks but she is too cute to get upset with.
      <br />
      <br /> Francy is sort of a homebody dog. She really enjoys snuggling up to my father, his girlfriend Jamie, or me. She loves her room she sleeps in and all other beds and cushions she can lounge on. I guess she figures that if she has it so good
      at home, why leave?<br />

      <br /> Francy really does not enjoy going to the groomer, <em>aka the salon</em> as my dad likes to call it. She especially hates going to the veterinarian. Her strong opinions of these places makes her resent long car rides that involve going outside
      of the neighborhood that she knows. She gets very worked up in long car rides. During my freshman year of college (2015), my father drove down to Delaware to visit me and he brought Francy Along. She was a very anxious pup. <br />
